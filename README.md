# lite.py

Creating and deleting bosh directors using
[bosh-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment)
is convenient, but requires long commands with many arguments.

Using `lite` retains the convenience of `bosh-deployment` without the
tediosuness.

## Installation

Move `lite` into your `PATH`.
